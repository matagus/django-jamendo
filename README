So far it only contains models, urls, views and templates giving you a
full browsable-data app. It lacks of jamendo webservice/api updates for
some models fields (ie: album image) or entire models (revisions,
playlists, etc), feeds (rss/atom) and some other features that I'll be
developing during nexts months. Please see TODO file in root directory.
